		<p>“Agreement” means this End User Agreement, the &lt;<a
 href="/info/conduct">User Conduct Policy</a>&gt;, the &lt;<a
 href="/info/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>&gt;, the terms and conditions of any particular Service (each, a “Service Addendum”), as well as all other terms and conditions that are posted on the Site or attached to this Agreement, and each amendment to any of the foregoing, all of which are incorporated here by reference.  In case of a conflict between the Agreement and any Service Addendum, the provisions of such Service Addendum shall take precedence over those in the Agreement.  In the case of a conflict between this End User Agreement and the Site Policies, or the Privacy Policy, or other terms and conditions that are posted on the Site or attached to this Agreement, the provisions of the Site Policies, the Privacy Policy or other terms and conditions that are posted on the Site or attached to this End User Agreement, as the case may be, will take precedence over those in this End User Agreement.</p>
		<p>ProgressBound may amend the Agreement from time to time by posting an amendment on the Site. The amended Agreement becomes effective immediately after an amendment is posted on the Site and accepted by Supporter.  Although ProgressBound will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a Supporter with at least seven (7) days advance notice of any such amendment, Supporter acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be permitted to access or use the Services after the amendment is posted on the Site until Supporter has accepted such amendment.  The Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing signed by the parties.</p>
