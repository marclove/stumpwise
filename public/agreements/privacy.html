	<h3>Collection of personal information</h3>

	<p>In order to provide our full range of services and the best customer experience, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

	<p>User Information Some aspects of our web site allow you and/or require you to submit personal information to us via internet browser based forms or by sending us an e-mail. Such personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, photo, bank and/or credit card account information, other payment service information (such as PayPal) and other demographic information. We may retain some or all of such information in order to process requests from you, respond to communication and/or to improve our service. When you register for an account you will also be asked to create a password for access to certain parts of our web site. Passwords are stored as hash values (a mathematical representation of your password) on our systems. No one at ProgressBound can retrieve your password. We may also communicate with you through certain newsletters and promotional e-mails based on your personal information. You may review and request changes to your personal information stored on our active systems by logging onto your account (if you registered on our web site) or by contacting us at the e-mail or mailing address above.</p>

	<p>Logs By accessing our web site, our internet servers automatically record information your internet browser sends when you visit a web site. These logs may contain information such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser version, domain name, language, date and time, the referring web site and information in your cookie files (see below for more information regarding cookie files). Through your use of certain aspects of our web site, we also may collect transactional information based on your activity on our web site. Such information may include logs of [content generation, account related activities on the web site, and correspondence through the web site with us and with other users of the web site.]</p>

	<p>Cookies When you browse our web site, we may send your internet browser one or more small files commonly referred to as cookies. Cookie files allow us to uniquely identify your internet browser. We use cookie files to store information about you and to track your use of our web site. One type of cookie file we may send your internet browser is a session cookie which will automatically expire and be disabled when you exit your internet browser. We may also send your internet browser persistent cookie files which remain on your system after the end of your session and which we may access if you return to our web site at a later time. Your internet browser may allow you to disable or remove our cookie files; however, your ability to access and/or use of certain portions of our web site may be affected by taking such action.</p>

	<h3>Use and sharing of your personal information</h3>

	<p>We will use your personal information in order to (i) provide our services or information about our services to you, (ii) analysis in order to improve our services and operations, (iii) research and product development, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights of our users and (v) for the specific reasons outlined on our web site when we collect your information. If we use your information for a purpose different from those outlined above, we will ask for your consent prior to such use. You may choose to opt-out of such use at such time.</p>

	<p>We will not share your personal information with third parties unless we have your consent or unless we have a good faith belief we are required to share such information to (i) comply with applicable law, (ii) prevent fraud, (iii) protect the rights, property or personal safety of ProgressBound, its officers, directors or employees, our users and the public. We may share certain aggregated, non-personal information collected from you (such as your browser type) with third parties in order to improve our services, but such information will not be sufficient to individually identify you. We will not share your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your consent. If you give us your consent for such sharing, but later decide to revoke such consent, you may change your preferences by logging onto your account on our system or by contacting us at the e-mail or mailing address above.</p>

	<p>Our web site allows you to make certain personal information about you generally available to other users of our web site. Our <a href="/info/supporters">Terms of Use</a> restricts how other users of our web site may use such information, but you should use caution in making personal information generally available to all users of our web site.</p>

	<p>Our web site may allow you to e-mail a third party an invitation to use our web site. We will not use any e-mail address you provide us for such invitations except to process your request and for statistical tracking.</p>

	<h3>Security of your personal information</h3>

	<p>We take reasonable measures to identify and prevent unauthorized access to our systems and disclosure of your personal information. We use secure server software (SSL) encryption for certain of our services and reasonable other security measures for the remainder of our web site. We also restrict access to your personal information to only those persons who need to know the information in order to perform the services we offer. Your personal information may be stored on computer systems maintained by an agent or service provider of ProgressBound, each of which will be bound by agreement to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. Our computer systems are located in the United States of America, but the computer systems of our service providers may be located in another country. We therefore may transmit your personal information outside the United States of America. In the event of merger or bankruptcy, all Personally Identifiable Information will be destroyed. Personal information may be disclosed to judicial or other government agencies subject to warrants, subpoenas, or other governmental orders.</p>

	<h3>This privacy policy does not apply to third parties</h3>

	<p>This privacy policy applies only to information that we collect from you. Certain portions of our web site may direct your internet browser to a third party web site or a portion of our web site controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window separate from other content on our web site). Disclosure of personal information to such third party shall be subject to the terms of such third party's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policy or content of web sites that we do not own, even if such a site is linked on our web site.</p>

	<h3>Protection of Children</h3>

	<p>Our web site is not designed or directed for use by children. If we become aware a person under the age of 13 has provided us personal information, we will discontinue the use of such information and remove it from our systems. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable or demographic information form children under the age of 13.</p>

	<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>

	<p>Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent. As part of the California Online Privacy Protection Act, all users of our site may make any changes to their information at anytime by logging into their control panel and going to the 'My Profile' page.</p>
