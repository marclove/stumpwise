IF YOU CLICK “I AGREE”, OR SIGN A HARD COPY OF THE MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT AND RETURN IT TO PROGRESSBOUND AT THE ADDRESS INDICATED, OR ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU (I) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE AGREEMENT, (II) ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, AND (III) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AGREEMENT HAS THE SAME FORCE AND EFFECT AS A SIGNED AGREEMENT IF YOU CLICK “I AGREE” OR ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<h3>AGREEMENT DEFINITION</h3>
		<p>“Agreement” means this Campaign Agreement, the &lt;<a href="/info/conduct">User Conduct Policy</a>&gt;, the &lt;<a href="/info/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>&gt;, the terms and conditions of any particular Service (each, a “Service Addendum”), as well as all other terms and conditions that are posted on the Site or attached to this Membership Agreement, and each amendment to any of the foregoing, all of which are incorporated here by reference.  In case of a conflict between the Agreement and any Service Addendum, the provisions of such Service Addendum shall take precedence over those in the Agreement.  In the case of a conflict between the Campaign Agreement and the Site Policies, or the Privacy Policy, or other terms and conditions that are posted on the Site or attached to this Membership Agreement, the provisions of the Site Policies, the Privacy Policy or other terms and conditions that are posted on the Site or attached to this Campaign Agreement, as the case may be, will take precedence over those in the Campaign Agreement.</p>
		<p>ProgressBound may amend the Agreement from time to time by posting an amendment on the Site. The amended Agreement becomes effective upon a Campaign and its Users (as defined below) immediately after an amendment is posted on the Site and accepted by such Campaign and its Users via click-through or a signed writing of such amendment.  Although ProgressBound will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a Campaign at least seven (7) days advance notice of any such amendment, Campaign acknowledges and agrees that it and its Users shall not be permitted to access or use the Services after the amendment is posted on the Site until an authorized representative of the Campaign and, thereafter, such Campaign’s Users have accepted such amendment.  The Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing signed by the parties.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>ACCESS TO SERVICES; MEMBER ELIGIBILITY</h3>
		<p>Subject to the terms of the Agreement, ProgressBound and, in some instances, third party licensors (“Third Parties”) provide the products and services described more fully on the Site, including without limitation Website and CMS, List-building and CRM, Email Broadcasting, SMS Broadcasting, and Donation Processing (collectively, the "Services"), to political campaigns, political action committees, and other political and social causes/organizations (each a “Campaign”) and their Users.  “Users” are staff members and/or representatives designated by Campaign that (i) have completed the registration process and received an I.D. and Password (each as defined below), and (ii) can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Campaign represents and warrants that each person (including Users) executing and delivering this Agreement on behalf of Campaign has been duly authorized by Campaign to do so and shall legally bind Campaign.  For purposes of the Agreement, “Member” or “You” shall jointly and severally refer to a Campaign and each of its Users.  A User shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of his or her Campaign at all times. In the event that a User is no longer authorized to represent his or her Campaign, Campaign shall immediately notify ProgressBound in writing of (i) the removal of such User (including the effective date of such removal), and (ii) the appointment, if any, of a new User for the Campaign (including the effective date of such appointment).  A removal of a User (and the termination of such User’s membership privileges) or appointment of a new User (and the commencement of such new User’s membership privileges) shall be effective on the later of the third business day after ProgressBound’s receipt of a written notice from Campaign or a date otherwise specified by Campaign.  A Campaign shall not be responsible or liable for the actions of a former User once such User’s removal is effective.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>FEES</h3>
		<p>There is currently no charge for becoming a Member; however, ProgressBound may institute such a fee in the future upon notice to Member.  Member agrees to pay the fees and costs associated with the use of the Services in accordance with and to the extent provided in the applicable Service Addendum.  Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Service Addendum and except for ProgressBound’s income taxes, Member is responsible for paying any state and federal sales tax, value-added taxes, use or other taxes due as a result of Member’s use of the Services.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>CHANGES TO SERVICES</h3>
		<p>While ProgressBound’s objective is to make the Site accessible 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week, ProgressBound may make the Site, or any portion thereof, unavailable from time to time for any reason including, without limitation, routine maintenance.  ProgressBound does not guarantee the availability or access of the Site, or of any feature, database, or Service available through the Site, or that access will be uninterrupted or error free.  ProgressBound reserves the right to interrupt, limit, change, suspend or discontinue the Site operations from time to time, with or without notice.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>PASSWORD AND I.D.</h3>
		<p>Access to and use of the Services requires Member to register with ProgressBound and, upon acceptance by ProgressBound and such Member’s Campaign administrator, select a name ("I.D.") and password (“Password”) that conforms to the rules and standards set forth on the Site or provided by ProgressBound from time to time. Member shall provide ProgressBound with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Member shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ProgressBound and its respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all liability that results from Member’s inaccurate or incomplete information. ProgressBound shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse registration of, or to suspend or cancel a Member Password and I.D .  Member shall be solely responsible for all information and instructions transmitted through the Site, or the use of any Services, using its I.D. or Password and, in the case of the Campaign, using the I.D. or password of any Member User. All information and instructions communicated through these means will be deemed to be sent and authorized by Member, and Member accepts full responsibility for such communications. Member shall take full responsibility and liability for the security of its I.D. and Password and, in the case of the Campaign, the security of each User’s I.D. and Password.  Member agrees to immediately notify ProgressBound of any unauthorized use of the Site, any Service or a Member’s account, or any other breach of security known to Member (it being understood that any User’s knowledge shall be imputed to the Campaign).  A Member shall have no further responsibility or liability (if any) after ProgressBound’s receipt of such notification.</p>

		<p>The term of the Agreement shall commence on the date that the Agreement is accepted by Member pursuant to Section 1 of this Membership Agreement and shall continue until terminated in accordance with this Section.  ProgressBound shall have the right to terminate the Agreement, without prior notice or liability, if Member (i) breaches any term, condition, rule or policy of the Agreement and Member has not cured within three (3) days of receiving written notice of the breach from ProgressBound, or (ii) does not visit the Site or use the Service(s) at least once during any two month period.
